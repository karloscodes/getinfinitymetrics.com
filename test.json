When you ask a question in plain English (e.g., \"Show me page views per day for the last week\"), the AI model (running via an API like OpenAI, which requires your own API key configured in the settings) translates your question into an SQL query. This SQL query is then executed *locally* against your own database on your server to retrieve the results. Only the natural language question itself is sent to the AI API for translation, not your underlying visitor data."
