          No Cookies, No Consent Banners Needed
        </h2>
        <p>
          Traditional analytics tools use cookies to track users across
          sessions, requiring consent banners under GDPR. Infinity Metrics is
          different:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Zero cookies used</strong> - We don't set any cookies on your
            visitors' browsers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No consent banners required</strong> - Since we don't use cookies
            or collect personal data, you don't need cookie consent banners
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Better user experience</strong> - Your visitors can enjoy your
            site without intrusive consent popups

          How We Protect Personal Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          Under GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified
          or identifiable natural person. Here's how Infinity Metrics ensures
          compliance:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>No personal data collection</strong> - We don't collect names,
            email addresses, or other directly identifiable information
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IP address protection</strong> - IP addresses are considered
            personal data under GDPR. We hash and salt IP addresses immediately upon
            collection and then discard the original IP, making identification impossible
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No cross-site tracking</strong> - Unlike other analytics tools,
            we don't track users across different websites
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No persistent identifiers</strong> - We don't use any persistent
            identifiers that could track users over time
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anonymized metrics only</strong> - We only provide aggregated,
            anonymized metrics that cannot be used to identify individuals
          </li>
        </ul>

            How Infinity Metrics Works Without Cookies
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Instead of cookies, we use a sophisticated but privacy-preserving
            method to generate anonymous session IDs:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Session-based tracking</strong> - We generate a temporary session
              ID that exists only in memory and expires after a short period of inactivity
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>One-way hashing</strong> - When a page is loaded, we take anonymous
              browser characteristics and apply a one-way hash function with site-specific
              salt
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Never stored on device</strong> - Unlike cookies, no identifiers
              are stored on the user's device
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mathematically non-reversible</strong> - Our hashing algorithm
              makes it mathematically impossible to derive the original information
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">How We Handle IP Addresses</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            IP addresses must be handled carefully under GDPR. Here's our
            process:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>
              IP address is briefly used to determine country (for geographic
              stats)
            </li>
            <li>
              IP is immediately hashed using a secure one-way algorithm with a
              unique salt for your website
            </li>
            <li>Original IP address is discarded completely</li>
            <li>
              The hash cannot be reversed to reveal the original IP address
            </li>
            <li>Even we cannot access or reconstruct the original IP</li>
          </ol>

          Under GDPR, any data processing requires a legal basis. Since Infinity

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> - As you don't process personal

            website usage patterns

          <li>
            <strong>No Consent Required</strong> - Since no cookies or personal data

          Infinity Metrics was built from the ground up to be GDPR-compliant by

          eliminate most GDPR concerns for website analytics. This privacy-first

          without compromising your visitors' privacy or your legal compliance.
