          <li>
            <strong>We (Infinity Metrics, the company) are the Data Processor</strong>
            only for the limited personal data we collect directly from you (our

            and payment processing (see our Privacy Policy).

          How the Software Design Aids Compliance
        </h2>

          No Cookies, No Consent Banners Needed (for Analytics)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Traditional analytics tools often use persistent cookies, requiring consent banners under GDPR. The Infinity Metrics software avoids this:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Zero cookies used by the software</strong> - The tracking script does not set cookies on your visitors' browsers for analytics purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent banners often not required for analytics</strong> - Since the software doesn't use cookies or collect personal data (when configured correctly), you likely don't need specific cookie consent banners *for the analytics function*. You may still need banners for other cookies or tracking used on your site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on User Experience</strong> - Helps you avoid intrusive consent popups related to analytics tracking.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> While the software avoids cookies, you, as the Data Controller, must still ensure your overall data collection practices comply with GDPR, including providing transparency in your site's privacy policy.

          How the Software Protects Visitor Personal Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Infinity Metrics software is designed to minimize the collection of personal data as defined by GDPR:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Designed for minimal data collection</strong> - The software aims to collect only aggregated, anonymized metrics necessary for understanding website trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IP address anonymization</strong> - IP addresses are used briefly for country-level geolocation, then immediately hashed (using a salt unique to your installation) and discarded. The original IP is never stored permanently by the software. This hashing process is one-way and designed to prevent re-identification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No cross-site tracking</strong> - The software operates only on the site where you install it. It does not track users across different websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No persistent user identifiers</strong> - The software generates user signatures based on IP address (anonymized) and User-Agent, salted uniquely per day per site. This prevents long-term tracking of individuals across days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on aggregated metrics</strong> - The primary output is anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., page views, visitor counts, session duration) that cannot reasonably be used to identify individuals.
          </li>
        </ul>

            How Infinity Metrics Works Without Cookies
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Instead of cookies, the software uses a privacy-preserving
            method to distinguish visits within a limited timeframe:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Daily Anonymous Signatures</strong> - For each visitor on a given day, a unique signature is generated using their anonymized IP address, User-Agent string, and a site-specific, daily-rotating salt. This allows distinguishing unique visits within a day without long-term tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>One-way hashing</strong> - This signature is created using a secure, one-way hash function. It's mathematically infeasible to reverse the hash to get the original IP or User-Agent data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not stored on device</strong> - No identifiers are stored on the user's device by the analytics script.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Session Calculation</strong> - Sessions are calculated based on the time between events from the same daily anonymous signature, typically resetting after 30 minutes of inactivity.
            </li>

            IP addresses must be handled carefully under GDPR. Here's our
            process:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>
              IP address is briefly held in memory for country lookup (if enabled).
            </li>

              IP is immediately hashed using a secure one-way algorithm combined
              with a unique, daily-rotating salt specific to your website installation.
            </li>
            <li>Original IP address is permanently discarded and never stored on disk.</li>
            <li>
              The hash cannot be reversed to reveal the original IP address.
            </li>
            <li>Neither you nor we can access the original visitor IP addresses from the stored data.</li>

          GDPR Rights and Your Visitors (Data You Collect)

          GDPR grants individuals rights regarding their personal data. Because the Infinity Metrics software is designed *not* to collect personal data that identifies individuals:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Right to access / rectification / erasure ('to be forgotten')</strong> - Since no identifiable personal data is stored by the software's default configuration, there is typically no personal data for visitors to access, correct, or delete from the analytics system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to data portability</strong> - Aggregated, anonymous data is not subject to portability requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to object to processing</strong> - Visitors can typically object by using browser privacy settings (like Do Not Track, which Infinity Metrics can be configured to respect) or browser extensions that block tracking scripts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must inform visitors about the analytics data you collect (even if anonymous) in your website's privacy policy and explain how they can exercise their rights, potentially including how to opt-out of tracking if you offer such a mechanism.

          While the Infinity Metrics software aids compliance, as the Data Controller for your visitor data, you must:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">

            <strong>Maintain a clear Privacy Policy:</strong> Inform your visitors that you use analytics, what data is collected (even if anonymous), why, and that it's hosted on your servers. Explain the privacy measures taken (like IP anonymization).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ensure Lawful Basis:</strong> Determine your legal basis for processing analytics data (likely Legitimate Interest for anonymous, aggregated data, but potentially Consent if you collect identifiable data via custom events/UTMs).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Configure Responsibly:</strong> Ensure you do not configure custom events or use UTM parameters to collect personal data without a proper legal basis and disclosures.

          <li>
            <strong>Secure Your Server:</strong> Protect the server hosting your Infinity Metrics installation and the collected data according to security best practices.

          <li>
            <strong>Data Processing Agreement (DPA):</strong> Since we (Infinity Metrics, the company) do not process your visitors' data, a DPA between you and us is generally not required *for that data*. You may need DPAs with your hosting provider or other processors.

        <p>
          As the Data Controller for the analytics data you collect using your self-hosted Infinity Metrics instance, you need a legal basis under GDPR.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> For collecting anonymous, aggregated website statistics (like page views, browser types, country), Legitimate Interest is often the appropriate legal basis. You must balance this interest against the rights and freedoms of your visitors (which are minimal when data is truly anonymous). You should document this assessment (LIA).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent:</strong> If you configure Infinity Metrics (e.g., via custom events or UTM parameters) to collect data that could be considered personal data, or if required by specific local laws (like ePrivacy Directive nuances), you may need to obtain explicit consent *before* collecting that data.
          </li>

        <p>
          The Infinity Metrics software is engineered to facilitate GDPR compliance for website analytics by minimizing data collection, avoiding cookies, and anonymizing potential identifiers like IP addresses. However, as a self-hosted solution, ultimate responsibility for GDPR compliance rests with you, the customer, as the Data Controller for the data you collect on your servers. Ensure you understand your obligations, maintain a transparent privacy policy, and configure the software responsibly.
