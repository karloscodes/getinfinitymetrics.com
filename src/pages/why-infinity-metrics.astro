          The Frustrations That Sparked a New Solution
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a website owner, I relied on web analytics to understand my
          audience, but the options out there left me frustrated. Free tools,
          like Google Analytics, seem convenient, but they come with a steep
          hidden cost: your users’ privacy. They often monetize user data by
          sharing it with third parties, forcing you to clutter your site with
          intrusive cookie banners to comply with regulations like GDPR. It’s a
          compromise that erodes user trust and complicates your setup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paid SaaS platforms, often marketed as privacy-first alternatives,
          solve some of these issues but introduce new frustrations. They don’t
          necessarily offer more features, just a higher price tag with
          recurring fees that scale with your traffic. The more your site grows,
          the more you pay, leaving you stuck in a cycle of endless payments
          with limited control over your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-hosted analytics seemed like a better path, but they brought
          their own challenges. Most options required complex setups, external
          database servers to pay for, and ongoing maintenance that felt
          overwhelming. I knew there had to be a better way to balance control,
          privacy, and simplicity.

          My Vision for Something Better
        </h2>
        <p>
          I wanted a solution that gave me full control over my data without the
          headaches. I envisioned a web analytics tool that prioritized user
          privacy and data ownership, all while requiring minimal maintenance
          effort so I could focus on insights, not infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also craved deeper insights than static dashboards could offer. I
          wanted to ask questions in plain language and get answers instantly,
          going beyond predefined charts and metrics. And if I ever needed to
          use another tool, I wanted direct access to the database file
          —unrestricted and on my terms.
        </p>

          Introducing Infinity Metrics
        </h2>

          That’s why I created Infinity Metrics, a self-hosted analytics
          platform that solves these problems and delivers on my vision. Here’s

            <strong>Unrestricted Data Access:</strong> Your data lives in a portable
            SQLite file. Query, export, or explore it with any tool you choose, your
            data, your rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI-Driven Insights:</strong> Go beyond dashboards with the AI
            assistant. Query your data in plain language to uncover insights that
            traditional tools can’t provide.

            is cookieless and GDPR-compliant by default, storing zero personal data.
            It runs on your server, ensuring no third-party access to your data.
          </li>

            and SQLite, setup is as simple as a single command. There’s no database
            server to manage, just a lightweight SQLite file for near-zero maintenance.
          </li>
        </ul>
