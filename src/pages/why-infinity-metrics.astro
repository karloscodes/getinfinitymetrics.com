          Third-Party Analytics Are a Trust Disaster
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let's be real: third-party analytics are a mess. You're genuinely
          curious about who's visiting your website, what brings them there,
          where they're from, what they care about.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what do you get? A trust disaster. These tools ship your users'
          data everywhere, to faceless vendors you wouldn't trust with a
          paperclip. Even if you trust these third parties, why would your
          users? They don't, and they're right not to. Nobody wants their info
          escaping to some stranger's database, scattered across the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          When data leaks out to these vendors, your credibility takes a hit.
          Users can tell when their info isn't safe, it's why they use
          adblockers, just like I do, stacking every privacy layer I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adblockers wreck your data because users hate being tracked. And
          you're left hoping these vendors don't mishandle or leak your users'
          data, shattering the trust you've built. For what? A clunky dashboard
          that's more hype than help? Come on. You're better than that, and your
          users deserve better.
        </p>

        <h2 id="first-party-solution" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          First-Party Analytics: Trust, Control, Curiosity
        </h2>
        <p>
          Here's the real deal: first-party analytics. It's just you and your
          users, no shady vendors, no data escaping everywhere, no nonsense.
        </p>
        <p>
          You get clean, reliable insights into who's visiting your site, where
          they're from, and what they're into, all kept in-house. It's about
          feeding your genuine interest in your audience while building trust
          and credibility, not burning them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your users see you're not selling them out to third parties they have
          no reason to trust. Adblockers? They don't touch you because you're
          not the creepy one.
        </p>
        <p>
          First-party analytics means control. Your data stays with you, not
          locked in someone else's system or scattered across the web. You get
          straightforward insights that fuel your curiosity without compromising
          user trust. It's simple, it's honest, it's how it should be.
        </p>
