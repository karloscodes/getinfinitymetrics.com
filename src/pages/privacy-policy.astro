        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction: Our Commitment & Your Role</h2>
        <p>
          At Infinity Metrics ("we", "us", or "our"), privacy is fundamental. This policy explains how we handle data related to our website (`getinfinitymetrics.com`) and the services we provide to you, our customer ("Customer", "you").
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, Infinity Metrics is <strong>self-hosted software</strong>. You install and run it on your own servers. This means:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>You control the analytics data</strong> collected from visitors ("End Users") to your website(s) using the software.</li>
          <li><strong>We do not collect, access, or process your End Users' data.</strong> That data resides entirely on your infrastructure.</li>
          <li>This policy primarily covers the data <strong>we collect directly from you</strong> (our Customer) and visitors to <strong>our website</strong> (`getinfinitymetrics.com`).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We've designed the Infinity Metrics software to help you collect analytics data in a privacy-respecting manner (no cookies, IP anonymization by default) to aid your compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. However, you remain the Data Controller for your End Users' data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data We Collect (About You, Our Customer, and Our Website Visitors)</h2>

        <p>We collect the following types of information directly:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you purchase a license or sign up, we collect information like your name, email address, and potentially company name. This is necessary to provide the service and manage your license.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you purchase a license, payments are processed by our third-party payment processor, <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do not store your full credit card details ourselves. Stripe handles this data according to their <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">privacy policy</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Website Usage Data (`getinfinitymetrics.com`):</strong> We use our own Infinity Metrics software on our website (`getinfinitymetrics.com`) to understand how visitors use it. This includes anonymous, aggregated data like page views, referral sources, device type, browser type, and country-level location. We use this data to improve our website and services. This collection follows the privacy-preserving principles of our software (no cookies, IP anonymization).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support or inquiries, we collect the information you provide in your messages (e.g., email address, content of the message).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>License Activation/Verification Data:</strong> We may collect minimal technical data necessary to verify your license status when the software checks for updates or validates the license key.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

       <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Collected by the Software (On Your Servers, About Your End Users)</h2>
         <p>
          When you install and run the Infinity Metrics software on your servers, it is designed to collect the following types of <strong>anonymous, aggregated data</strong> about your End Users by default:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Page URLs visited</li>
          <li>Referrer URLs (where visitors came from)</li>
          <li>Browser type (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)</li>
          <li>Operating System (e.g., Windows, macOS)</li>
          <li>Device type (e.g., Desktop, Mobile)</li>
          <li>Country derived from anonymized IP address</li>
          <li>UTM parameters (if present in URLs)</li>
          <li>Custom event data (if you configure it)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Privacy Features of the Software:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> The software does not use browser cookies for tracking.</li>
          <li><strong>IP Anonymization:</strong> IP addresses are immediately hashed with a daily rotating salt and discarded; the original IP is never stored.</li>
          <li><strong>No Persistent Identifiers:</strong> Daily unique signatures prevent long-term individual tracking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> All this End User data is stored <strong>exclusively on your servers</strong>. We never receive or access it unless you explicitly share specific logs or database excerpts with us for technical support purposes, under your control.
          You are responsible for securing this data and ensuring your use (including any custom event tracking) complies with all applicable privacy laws.

        <p>
          As the Data Controller for your End Users' data, you are responsible for handling their privacy rights requests (access, deletion, etc.) concerning the data collected by your Infinity Metrics instance. Since the default software configuration does not store identifiable personal data, fulfilling such requests often involves explaining that no personal data is held.
        </p>
        <p>Visitors to your website can often limit tracking by using browser settings (e.g., Do Not Track) or privacy-enhancing browser extensions.</p>
