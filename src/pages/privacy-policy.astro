        <p>
          Fusion Analytics ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting
          your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
          disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our product.
        </p>
        <p>
          We designed Fusion Analytics with privacy at its core. Unlike
          traditional analytics tools, our product:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Does not use cookies</li>
          <li>Does not collect personal data</li>
          <li>Does not track users across websites</li>
          <li>
            Is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This policy applies both to users of Fusion Analytics (website owners
          who install our product) and end-users (visitors to websites that use
          Fusion Analytics).

        <p>The anonymous analytics data we collect is:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            Processed to generate aggregated statistics for website owners

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Fusion Analytics is self-hosted by our customers on their own
          infrastructure. This means:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            Website visitor data remains under the complete control of the
            website owner
          </li>
          <li>Data is stored in a SQLite database on the customer's server</li>
          <li>
            We do not have access to the analytics data unless specifically
            granted by the customer for support purposes
          </li>
          <li>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
            secure the data during transmission
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While we provide recommendations for secure deployment, website owners
          are responsible for securing their own hosting environment.

        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third

        </ul>
        <p>
