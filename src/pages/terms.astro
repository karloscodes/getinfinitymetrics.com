          Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and
          self-hosted analytics software (the "Service"). By using it, you're

          <li>Features may change or be removed without prior notice.</li>
          <li>We'd love your feedback to make it better.</li>
          <li>Data loss might occur, so back up important information.</li>
          <li>Spots are limited; we can pause or end the beta anytime.</li>
          <li>Active participants score lifetime access perks.</li>

        <p>
          We can cut you off anytime if you break these Terms, no notice needed.

          can keep their installed version but we won't provide any further
          updates or support.
