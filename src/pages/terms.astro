        </p>
        <p>
          By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with all of these Terms, then you are expressly prohibited from using the Service and you must discontinue use immediately.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. The Service: Self-Hosted Software</h2>
         <p>
          Infinity Metrics provides self-hosted web analytics software. This means you download, install, configure, and run the software on your own server infrastructure. You are responsible for providing and managing the necessary hosting environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide the software license; you control its operation and the data it collects about visitors to your website(s) ("End User Data"). We do not access, store, or process your End User Data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Beta Status & Early Access (If Applicable)</h2>
        <p>
          Note: This section applies if you obtained the Service during a beta or early access period. We may be rolling out Infinity Metrics via an exclusive waitlist or beta program. If so:

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Updates:</strong> Your license purchase grants you access to the current version of the software and typically includes updates (bug fixes, minor feature enhancements) released within a certain period after purchase (e.g., one year, as specified at purchase). Major future versions or significant new feature modules released beyond this period may require an additional purchase or upgrade fee.

All payments are processed through our third-party payment processor, <strong>Stripe</strong>. By providing payment information, you agree to Stripe's terms and privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your analytics live on your server. We don't peek unless you invite us
          for support. You're solely responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As the Service is self-hosted, the security, availability, and reliability of your End User Data depend entirely on the measures you implement. You are solely responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Implementing robust server security, access controls, and monitoring.</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">12. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms remain in effect until terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may terminate or suspend your license and access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. We particularly reserve the right to terminate your license if we detect or reasonably suspect:
        </p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
           <li>Violation of the license restrictions (Section 6), including resale or redistribution.</li>
           <li>Use of the Service for illegal, fraudulent, or harmful activities.</li>
           <li>Attempts to circumvent license validation.</li>
           <li>Actions that compromise the security or integrity of the Service or harm other users (though unlikely given the self-hosted nature, this clause covers unforeseen issues).</li>
           <li>Material breach of any other provision of these Terms.</li>
         </ul>
        <p>
          Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately. You must cease all use of the software and destroy any copies in your possession. Provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you received a lifetime license during a beta or promotional period, termination for breach of these Terms will still revoke your right to use the software and receive updates or support.
