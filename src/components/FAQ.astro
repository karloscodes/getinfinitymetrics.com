  },
  {
    question: "How easy is the setup?",
    answer:
      "One command, done. Installs in seconds via Docker, no fuss. Updates? They're automated, zero-downtime, and always backward-compatible.",

    question: "Do updates cost extra?",
    answer:
      "Updates within the same major version (1.0 to 1.1) are free. Regarding major version upgrades (1.x to 2.x), I'm still determining the pricing structure. Since this is a new product, I want to be honest that I haven't finalized how future major version upgrades will be handled yet. You'll always have the choice whether to upgrade to a new major version when the time comes.",
  },
