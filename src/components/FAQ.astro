  {
    question: 'How does cookieless tracking work?',
    answer: 'Fusion Analytics uses a combination of techniques including fingerprinting and session-based analytics without storing personal information. This approach provides accurate data while respecting user privacy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the server requirements?',
    answer: 'Fusion Analytics is incredibly lightweight. You need a server that can run Docker. Even the most basic VPS with 512MB RAM will work fine for most websites.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it really GDPR compliant?',
    answer: 'Yes! Since we don\'t use cookies or store any personal data, you don\'t need consent banners. We only collect anonymous usage data that can\'t be tied back to individual users.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I export my data?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Your data is stored in a SQLite database that you have full access to. You can query it directly, export it, or connect it to your own tools.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer refunds?',
    answer: 'Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you\'re not satisfied with Fusion Analytics for any reason, just let us know and we\'ll refund your purchase.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do updates work?',
    answer: 'Updates are simple with our Docker-based installation. Just pull the latest version and restart the container. We design updates to be zero-downtime and backward compatible.'
  }
